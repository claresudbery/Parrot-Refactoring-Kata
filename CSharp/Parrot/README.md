Below are the steps I took to reach the state the code is currently in.

They may not exactly match the commit history, as in some cases I thought of optimisations after I'd already committed.

# Demo on MacBook (in Rider) - using inheritance

- General useful shortcuts:
    - Cmd + Shift + R brings up refactoring menu
        - below I'll just use the shorthand [R] to mean `Cmd + Shift + R`
    - Option/Alt + Enter to bring up lightbulb menu ("intention actions")
        - below I'll just use the shorthand [AE]
- Replace constructor with factory method
    - Place cursor in name of constructor
    - [AE] => To factory method
- Remove redundant cast expressions in `ParrotTest.cs` - all at once
    - put cursor in one of the greyed out enum type casts
    - [AE] => right arrow => Remove redundant cast expressions in file
- Change access modifier of constructor
    - Place cursor in access modifier (ie "public")
    - [AE] => To protected
        - (protected means the code can only be accessed by code in the same class or a derived class - so, like private but extended to the inheritance hierarchy)
        - so it can be accessed by descendants
        - at this point you'll get a green squiggly - because it's not being accessed by any descendants yet, so the IDE doesn't think it needs to be protected
- Create `EuropeanParrot` class
    - Add a switch statement to `CreateInstance` where you switch on `type`
    - add a case for `ParrotTypeEnum.EUROPEAN`
    - type `return new EuropeanParrot();` in the case
    - place cursor in name of non-existent class (highlighted in red)
    - [AE] => Create type
    - [AE] => Implement missing members
    - Back up to `CreateInstance`: red squiggly because no params passed to constructor
        - start typing `type` inside brackets and it will give you option to select and auto-complete
        - keep adding commas after each one and it will keep giving you options to select and auto-complete
    - one more red squiggly:
        - place cursor in call to constructor
        - [AE] => make constructor public
- Override method
    - type the word override and then a space
    - you will be given suggestions - you'll see `GetSpeed` is not available yet
- Change Signature of GetSpeed
    - Place cursor in function name
    - [AE] => To virtual
        - so we can override it in descendants
- Override method
    - type the word override and then a space
    - you will be given suggestions
    - edit the return statement to return the relevant code from the European case in the parent
        - you'll get a red squiggly saying cannot access private method
- Change access modifier of GetBaseSpeed
    - Place cursor in access modifier (ie "private")
    - [AE] => To protected
        - So we can call it in descendants
- Get rid of unnecessary case in parent version of `GetSpeed`
- Move class to its own file
    - Place cursor in name of class
    - [AE] => Move to EuropeanParrot.cs
- Get rid of unnecessary `type` param in constructor
    - Replace first arg passed to base constructor with hard-coded `ParrotTypeEnum` value
    - Put cursor in `type` param in constructor
    - [R] => Safe Delete
- Repeat relevant steps to create classes for other parrot types
    - for `AfricanParrot` and `NorwegianBlueParrot`
    - Override `GetSpeed` for them both
    - For `AfricanParrot`:
        - You'll get red squigglies for `GetLoadFactor` and `_numberOfCoconuts`
        - For each one, [AE] => Make protected
    - For `NorwegianBlueParrot`:
        - You'll get red squigglies for `_isNailed` and `_voltage`
        - For each one, [AE] => Make protected
        - You'll still have a red squiggly on `_voltage`
            - This is because the overloaded version of `GetBaseSpeed` in parent needs to be protected
            - Go to parent method, [AE] => To protected
- Get rid of switch statement in `GetSpeed`
    - return 0 instead
- Add default case to switch statement in `CreateInstance`
    - `default: throw new ArgumentException($"Invalid type: {type}");`
    - Remove final return statement
        - [AE] => Remove unreachable code
- Make `Parrot` class abstract
    - Just have to type `abstract` between `public` and `class`
- Make `GetSpeed` abstract
    - Place cursor in `virtual` or function name
    - [AE] => To abstract
- Introduce relevant fields in all derived classes
    - Look at what they need in their version of `GetSpeed`
    - Rename parent version with `_parent` suffix
        - place cursor in var name
        - [R] => Rename
        - Do NOT accept suggested changes for arg names (just uncheck the parent checkbox)
    - Place cursor in relevant param in derived constructor
    - [AE] => Introduce read-only field
    - Then change the version referenced in `GetSpeed` to be the new field
    - For some (eg `isNailed`), they will become redundant in parent class
        - Remove it
        - you can tell cos it's greyed out
        - put cursor in var declaration
        - [R] => Safe Delete
    - For some (eg `voltage`), they can be made private in parent class
        - [AE] => Make private
- Remove constructor params not needed in parent class
    - you can tell cos they're greyed out
    - put cursor in param declaration
    - [R] => Safe Delete
- Remove constructor params not needed in sub-classes
    - you can tell cos they're greyed out
    - put cursor in param declaration
    - [R] => Safe Delete
- Move `GetLoadFactor` from parent class to `AfricanParrot`
    - put cursor in name of method
    - [R] => Push members down
    - select `AfricanParrot` only
- Make `GetLoadFactor` private in `AfricanParrot`
    - put cursor in `protected`
    - [AE] => make method private
- Move overloaded `GetBaseSpeed` (with param) from parent class to `NorwegianBlueParrot`
    - put cursor in name of method
    - [R] => Push members down
    - select `NorwegianBlueParrot` only
- Make `GetBaseSpeed` private in `NorwegianBlueParrot`
    - put cursor in `protected`
    - [AE] => make method private
- Get `GetCry()` functionality working
    - !! Note that when I originally wrote this code / these instructions, I hadn't yet merged in the `GetCry()` functionality
    - When I did, I had to re-introduce the `_type` and `_voltage` member vars to the parent class
- Make `GetCry` virtual - change its signature
    - Place cursor in function name
    - [AE] => To virtual
        - because we're going to override it in descendants
- Override `GetCry` method in each sub-class
    - type the word override and then a space
    - You will be given suggestions
    - Replace default return value with value specific to this sub-class
        - copy from switch statement in parent
        - For `NorwegianBlueParrot` you'll need to replace `_voltage_parent` with `_voltage`
    - Remove relevant case from switch statement in parent class version of `GetCry`
- Get rid of switch statement in `GetCry`
    - return empty string instead
- Make `GetCry` abstract
    - Place cursor in `virtual` or function name
    - [AE] => To abstract
- Remove unneeded `_type` and `_voltage_parent` member vars in `Parrot` parent class
    - you can tell cos they're greyed out
    - put cursor in var declarations
    - [R] => Safe Delete
- Remove constructor params not needed in parent class
    - you can tell cos they're greyed out
    - put cursor in param declaration
    - [R] => Safe Delete
- Remove unneeded calls to base constructor from sub-classes
    - put cursor in call to `base()`
    - [AE] => Remove redundant base()
- Remove redundant constructor in parent class
    - put cursor in constructor name
    - [AE] => Remove redundant constructor
- Remove constructor params not needed in sub-classes
    - you can tell cos they're greyed out
    - put cursor in param declaration
    - [R] => Safe Delete
- Remove redundant constructor in `EuropeanParrot` class
    - put cursor in constructor name
    - [AE] => Remove redundant constructor
- Remove unused using directives
    - Place cursor in greyed out using directives at top of any file
    - [AE] => right arrow => Remove unused using directives in solution
